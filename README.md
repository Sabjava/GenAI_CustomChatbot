# GenAI CustomChatbot

The chosen dataset consists of the news articles focusing on advancements in generative AI, including breakthroughs in technologies like GPT models, their applications in education and business communication, and industry trends such as competition among AI companies. Each record is a self-contained text field, formatted with the year, a brief description of the news, and the source. This dataset is particularly appropriate for the task as it directly aligns with the focus on generative AI, covers diverse and credible topics, and provides well-structured information that facilitates efficient processing using text embedding models like `text-embedding-ada-002`.

### Summary of Comparison 
(answers for Completion Model can be different from the notebook as the model returns different answer each time)

---

**Question 1:** What advancements have GPT models made in natural language processing?  
- **Answer 1 (Custom Query):**  
  *2023 - Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) continue to set benchmarks in natural language processing, enabling more human-like interactions, accurate translations, and complex text generation. These advancements make AI more accessible and useful in areas like education and business communication (Source: OpenAI, https://openai.com/research).*  

- **Answer 2 (Completion Model):**  
  *GPT models have made significant advancements in natural language processing by demonstrating impressive capabilities in language generation, understanding, and translation. These models have greatly improved the quality of text generated by AI systems and have brought significant advancements in tasks such as question-answering, dialogue generation, and summarization. GPT models have also shown progress in understanding context and handling diverse languages, dialects, and writing styles. They have also made significant progress in understanding complex language structures and performing tasks such as sentiment analysis.*  

- **Key Difference:**  
Answer 1 is specific, includes a timeline (2023), highlights advancements in human-like interactions and translations, and provides a source. Answer 2 is more general, lacks a timeline, and does not cite a source.

**Question 2:** What did DeepSeek do?  
- **Answer 1 (Custom Query):**  
  *2025 - Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street (Source: CNN, http://cnn.com).*  

- **Answer 2 (Completion Model):**  
  *DeepSeek was a search engine that was launched in 1999 by Excite@Home. It used natural language processing and artificial intelligence to enhance its search results and personalize them for each user. DeepSeek was known for its advanced technology and user-friendly interface, but it eventually lost popularity and was shut down in 2002.*  

- **Key Difference:**  
Answer 1 is accurate, relevant to the 2025 context, and provides a source, focusing on DeepSeek's AI app. Answer 2 is factually incorrect, mistaking DeepSeek for an outdated search engine.

**Question 3:** What is LLaMA?  
- **Answer 1 (Custom Query):**  
  *2023 - Meta introduces LLaMA, a large language model optimized for efficiency and scalability. LLaMA focuses on democratizing AI access while reducing computational costs for small-scale deployments (Source: Meta, https://ai.facebook.com/research).*  

- **Answer 2 (Completion Model):**  
  *LLaMA stands for Low-Level Model Analysis, an approach used in computer science and software engineering to analyze software models at a low level to detect errors, ensure efficiency, and optimize performance. It involves detailed analysis of code structures and functions to identify potential issues and improve overall software quality.*  

- **Key Difference:**  
Answer 1 provides the correct definition, timeline (2023), purpose, and source for LLaMA as Meta's large language model. Answer 2 is inaccurate, describing LLaMA as a technique for analyzing software models, which is unrelated to the AI context.
